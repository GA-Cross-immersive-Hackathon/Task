### Painting Elephants:
# [RealTime](http://real-time-app.herokuapp.com/)

**Purpose**
RealTime was built for General Assembly's GA Labs Cross-Immersive Hackathon in March 2015, with students and alums from WDI, UXDI, and PMI.

RealTime’s mission is to empower people to utilize their downtime productively by encouraging estimations of time required to complete a task, and comparing it to the actual time it took to complete that task.

**User stories**
- As a user, I want ...
    - to be able to list all of my tasks and understand how long each task will take to accomplish because I want to keep track of everything I have to accomplish.
    - to be able to see what tasks I can choose from based on how much time I have to spend at any given moment.
    - to know exactly how long it took me to complete a task on my task list, so that I can compare it to the amount of time I estimated it would take me to complete the task and better understand what my working habits really are.
    - to be able to elaborate on a task with more details that I can’t necessarily include in a shorter text space for the task itself.


**Technologies Used**
- CRUD app with Ruby on Rails framework with PostgresQL database.
- [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem for authentication
- Utilized AJAX calls
- Bootstrap for the front-end (JavaScript and jQuery)
